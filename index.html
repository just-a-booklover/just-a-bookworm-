        <p><strong>Plot: </strong>12 ("The adventures of Sherlock Holmes") + 11 ("The memoirs of Sherlock Holmes") short novels which narrate some peculiar Sherlock Holmes' cases.</p>
        
         <p><strong>My opinion: </strong>to be honest I decided to recommend in only one post 2 books (“The adventures of Sherlock Holmes” and “The memoirs of Sherlock Holmes”) because they are really similar books, they both narrate some Sherlock Holmes’ short stories, and because in the book I borrowed from the library there were both these books (and “the sign of the four” too).  Moreover, that edition is a really good one, it has the original illustrations from the Strand Magazine (but I can’t paste them in this post, if you want to see them visit <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations_from_The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes_by_Sidney_Paget">this</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations_from_The_Memoirs_of_Sherlock_Holmes_by_Sidney_Paget”>this</a> link). <br>
Even though at some point I got sick of the novels (I mean, they were 23!) because they had a scheme which was followed in nearly all those novels, when I think about the novels, I can’t help but love them. The “scheme” I mean is the one in the plot of the stories: the introduction to the novel, a client who arrives and explains his mystery/problem, brief investigations, explanation of the culprit and of how the crime went. But, even if this schemes repeats in all the short novels, they’re all completely different from one another: sometimes an introduction was a consideration, and sometimes a discussion between Holmes and Watson. And, of course, the crimes Holmes was called to solve were all different and weird enough to make me love them, some of these at the beginning didn’t seem to be crimes at all, just strange things.<br>
I also observed that in Doyle’s book the culprit was easier to guess than in Christie’s, but what makes Sherlock Holmes really unique and amazing is that’s impossible to understand (without Holmes’ explanation) <em>how</em> the crime was committed. And every time he explained I was shocked and amazed. I was always impatient to read these brilliant solutions and all the explanations to the little deductions he made when he had met a stranger.<br>
The only thing which really annoyed me in these books is the fact that the short novels weren’t  ordered chronologically.<br>
But there were 3 novels which didn’t follow the scheme, as the others: “A scandal in Bohemia” in the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and “The adventure of the Greek interpreter” and “The adventure of the final problem” in the Meomoirs Sherlock Holmes.<br>
The first one is the short novel which I liked the most and which impressed me the most because it introduced Irene Adler and I loved her from the very beginning. She’s a very unique and well-described character. According to Sherlock she is “<em>the</em> woman”and, even if she appears only in “A scandal in Bohemia”, she really impressed me. But when I think about her the TV show “Sherlock” I feel disappointed because they portraited her in a very bad way, totally different to the book-Irene.<br>
In the Greek interpreter adventure was presented <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Mycroft_Holmes.jpg/149px-Mycroft_Holmes.jpg”>Mycroft Holmes</a>, Sherlock’s brother. I have to say that he intrigued me too, and I would like to read more stories with him (even if in some moths maybe, I’ve had enough Sherlock Holmes). Another time, the TV show “Sherlock” isn’t that accurate: it showed rivalry between the brothers when the book explains friendship and collaboration.<br>
And how could I not write about <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/The_Adventure_of_the_Final_Problem_03.jpg/158px-The_Adventure_of_the_Final_Problem_03.jpg”>Professor James Moriarty</a>? He really struck me, even if I mention him more because he’s important in the Sherlock Holmes universe than because I liked him. It’s a weird character, but I don’t think somebody could like Moriarty. Maybe appreciate, but not like. Questo personaggio mi ha davvero colpito, anche se lo menziono più per la sua importanza che per il fatto che mi sia piaciuto. By the way, I’m happy I compared the Moriarty-book with the Moriarty-show (and for once I’m satisfied with the Moriarty-show).

        <p><strong>Spoiler alert: </strong>how couldn’t I love Mycroft and Irene? (And Sherlock). <br>
By the way, when Sherlock died I was so upset and shocked. And the readers didn’t have to ask Doyle to bring him back to life, I hate when readers do things like this. I mean- HE IS THE AUTHOR, NOT YOU, AND HE HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER HIS CHARACTERS LIVE OR DIE!!! Anyway, I read somewhere Sherlock remains “dead” for 3 years and in these 3 years he secretly helps an intelligence organization or something like that. THE TV SHOW IS SO GOOD!!!
